# How Computers Work
__Three Things I Learned__
* The Binary number system is kinda cool because 1s and 0s can be like the true and false of boolean in Javascript. 
* Computers still operate on the same hardward that I learned about in the late 1990s when I worked at Gateway in Sioux City. It's nice to know some things stay the same in the world. 
* Circuits and signals are fun. Kids always enjoy working with them when we do stuff with the Arduino. It's something I do as a volunteer in my spare time. 

__Things Someone Should Know__
* Software is all the code that runs on the machine hardware.
* Computer hardware generally consists of the CPU - Central Processing Unit, Memory, Inputs, and Outputs. 
* Computers use Binary language made up of 1s and 0s, circuits, and signals to transmit information.
