_Key Questions to Ask When Starting a New Site_
* Who is the site for?
* Why will people visit your site? 
* What are people trying to do on your site? Order? Gather information?
* What information do site visitors need to accomplish their purpose for visiting?

_Site Maps and Wireframes_
* Site maps help plan the structure of the site. Wireframes organize the information in the site.
* A helpful technique to use is *card sorting*, which is arranging information on cards or paper and organizing them intuitively into a site map and then wireframe.

_Visual Design_
* Visual design helps users understand what you are trying to communicate in terms of what's important, what's next, and what to do first. Visual contrast and visual hierarchy help explain those concepts through design.
