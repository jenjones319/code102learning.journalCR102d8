# Dynamic Web Pages With Javascript
__How Do I Write Script For A Web Page__
* HTML provides content, CSS provides presentation, JS  provides behavior.
* Javascript is written in plain text, just like CSS and HTML.
* The HTML script tag tells the browser about the javascript, the src attribute tells where the js file is stored. 
* like css it's best to put js into its own file. 
* javascript has objects, methods, parameters, and member operator.
* browsers stop to run the script when it comes across them.

__Basic Javascript Instructions__
* A script is instructions that a computer follows one by one. 
* Each instruction or step is known as a *statement*. All statements end with a semi-colon
* It's best practice to write comments to explain with the code does.
* Comments are written like this //create a new date object or //find the current hour.
* statements surrounded by curly brackets are *code blocks*
* to write a multi-line comment, those must start with /* and end with */ so the computer doesn't get confused.
* variables are used to store bits of information the scripts need to perform.
* the pieces of a variable are variable keyword, variable name, variable value, assignment operator. 
* data types include numeric, string data, boolean. also arrays, undefined, and null. Numeric are numbers. String data has quotes, boolean is true or false.
* pgs 63-69 include info on how to use a var to store a number, store a string, store a boolean. p 67 shows shorthand for creating var
* var names have six rules on p. 69
