# Programming With Java Script
__Intro and Scripts__
* Scripts are Instructions
* Define the goal, design the script, write the code

__Expressions and Operators__
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to create a single value from one or more values.
* The plus symbol joins strings on either side of it. 
* A number with quote marks around it is a string. 

__Functions__
* Functions are a group of states that perform a task.
* When you invoke a task, you are calling it.
* Pieces of info passed to a function are called parameters.
* To create a function, give it a name, write the statements needed to execute what's inside the curly braces. This is a function declaration. 
* Then, you can call the function.
* JS has several predefined functions, or create a new one.
