# Operators and Loops
__Comparison and Logical Operators__
* Greater than/less than and greater or equal/less than equal are intuitive
* Two equals is equal to
* Three is strict equals
* != is not equal to !== strict not equal
* Logical operators are && is logical and, || logical or, ! logical not.

__For and While Loops__
* for (var i=0; i < 10; i++) {
    document.write(i);
}
* for loops are used to run through the items in an array
* while loops are used as long as a condition is present.
* do while loops have the statements in the code block coming before the condition.
