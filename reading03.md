About Git
* Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS), this means it has mirrored clones so multiple people can work from different physical locations. 
* The local Git repository has three components:
  1. Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
  2. Index: The area used for staging
  3. Head: Points to the most recent commit
